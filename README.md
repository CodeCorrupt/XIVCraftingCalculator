# XIV Crafting Calculator

This is a simple program to spit out the most profitable thing you can craft given the following assumptions:
* We only care about recipes where everything can be bought/sold on the marketboard
* We won't craft any of the ingredients for the main craft
* Universalis is the absolute truth for selling price and is always up to date (HA!)
* Everything sells quickly and is "in demand"
* Everything is in stock
* You only want to craft with one crafting class

So it's basically useless... _for now_

### TODO
- [ ] Take into account sale velocity
- [ ] Take into account market quantity
- [ ] Take into account Universalis being out of date
- [ ] Take into account multiple crafting classes being leveled
- [ ] Calculate subcraft profitability v. buying from marketboard
- [ ] Cache API call results (rate limiting will make it very slow)
- [ ] Make into an API
- [ ] Make web UI
- [ ] A ton of other things...
